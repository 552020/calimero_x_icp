The Integration Developer builds the system that connects:
- Mining module (from Core Developer)
- ICP canister (from ICP Developer)
- Network communication between nodes

The clear separation of responsibilities between Core and Integration developers ensures efficient development and maintenance of the mining system while maintaining system integrity and performance.
