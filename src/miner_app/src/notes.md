Block Structure Improvements:


 - timestamp field
 - block height/index
 - merkle root for transaction verification
 - block version or protocol version
 - transaction fees or gas considerations
 - signature verification for transactions


Transaction Limitations:


 - digital signatures for transaction authentication
 - nonce/sequence numbers to prevent replay attacks
 - input/output validation
 - transaction types (just simple transfers)
 - support for smart contract calls
 - fee structure or gas pricing


Mining Concerns:


Single-threaded mining is inefficient
 - difficulty adjustment mechanism
 - network difficulty consensus
 - uncle/orphan block handling
 - pooled mining support
 - reward mechanism for miners


ICP Canister Integration Issues:


 - actual canister interface defined
Missing proper ICP principal handling
 - cycles management
 - state management between mining nodes
Missing proper serialization for canister calls
 - error handling for network issues


Security Concerns:


Basic SHA256 implementation without proper salt
 - protection against 51% attacks
 - double-spend prevention
 - Sybil attack protection
Missing proper consensus mechanism
 - peer validation

Would you like me to help implement any of these missing features, particularly the ICP canister integration aspects?
