### Introduction: Selection of a 128-bit Hash Algorithm for our miner

In blockchain mining, hash algorithms play a critical role in ensuring the security and integrity of the network. While most blockchain systems (like Bitcoin) use 256-bit algorithms (e.g., SHA-256), we decided to explore alternatives that reduce the computational burden while maintaining sufficient security. The constraint of using a 128-bit hash aims to allow miners with standard personal computers to participate effectively. 
We examine the suitability of several 128-bit hash algorithms—namely, **SipHash**, **Blake2b**, and a **truncated SHA-256**—to determine which one best balances security, performance, and miner accessibility.

### Comparative Table: SipHash vs. Blake2b vs. Truncated SHA-256

| Feature                | **SipHash**                                                             | **Blake2b**                                                                         | **Truncated SHA-256**                                                            |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Security**           | Resistant to collision and preimage attacks, cryptographically secure with a secret key. | Similar security level to SHA-3; one of the most secure hash functions.           | SHA-256 offers strong security but truncated to 128 bits may weaken resistance.  |
| **Output Size**        | 64-bit or 128-bit output possible (can be truncated to 128-bit).         | Configurable output: 128-bit, 256-bit, or 512-bit.                                  | Fixed output (256-bit); truncated to 128-bit.                                   |
| **Speed**              | Extremely fast for short messages (e.g., <1KB); performs well on smaller datasets. | Fast for both short and long inputs; slightly more computationally expensive than SipHash. | Speed remains similar to SHA-256, with some slight overhead from truncation.     |
| **Key Requirement**    | Requires a 128-bit secret key for security.                              | Optional key; can operate without a key or with a secret key for HMAC functionality. | No key required.                                                                 |
| **Use Case**           | Lightweight hashing, hash table lookups, and potential lightweight miners. | Cryptographic applications, blockchain mining, data integrity checks, and signatures. | Used for standard cryptographic functions but truncated for specialized mining.   |
| **Complexity**         | Simple to implement, with minimal overhead for short data.               | More complex than SipHash, with higher setup and parameterization options.           | Simple, but requires truncation logic and may be inefficient for this purpose.    |
| **Performance**        | Optimal for smaller data sizes (short inputs) and highly efficient on low-power systems. | High performance for both short and large inputs, although slightly heavier than SipHash. | Relatively high performance, but truncation adds overhead.                       |
| **Flexibility**        | Limited flexibility; designed for specific use cases like lookups.       | Highly flexible, can output different lengths and support both keyed and unkeyed use. | Limited flexibility, only useful for creating a 128-bit hash from a 256-bit input.|
| **Collision Resistance**| Strong resistance, assuming key secrecy is maintained.                 | Very strong resistance to collision attacks, widely regarded as highly secure.      | Truncated hashes may introduce vulnerabilities depending on the use case.         |
| **Examples**           | Used in applications like hash tables, lightweight miners, and integrity checks. | Used in blockchain mining, cryptographic security, and digital signatures.         | Used as a compromise between efficiency and security in blockchain contexts.      |

### Detailed Evaluation

1. **SipHash:**
   - **Strengths**: SipHash is designed to be fast and efficient for short messages, which makes it particularly useful in cases where hash performance for small inputs is critical. It is ideal for lightweight miners due to its minimal overhead, and its 128-bit output naturally fits the constraint for personal computer-based mining.
   - **Weaknesses**: While SipHash is cryptographically secure, it may not be the best choice for larger datasets or complex mining operations where high throughput is needed. The key requirement for security means miners need to manage the secret key, adding some complexity.

2. **Blake2b:**
   - **Strengths**: Blake2b is a high-performance cryptographic hash function that is widely considered to be one of the most secure options available, with collision resistance similar to SHA-3. It offers flexibility with its configurable output sizes, which can include 128-bit, 256-bit, or even 512-bit hashes.
   - **Weaknesses**: While Blake2b is highly secure and performant for both short and large messages, it is slightly more computationally expensive than SipHash. For blockchain miners using standard personal computers, the extra complexity and slightly higher computational overhead may be a concern.

3. **Truncated SHA-256:**
   - **Strengths**: SHA-256 is already a well-established and highly secure hash function used in many cryptocurrencies. Truncating SHA-256 to 128 bits makes it a potential candidate for meeting the 128-bit requirement. It also benefits from the extensive cryptographic analysis that SHA-256 has undergone, ensuring a high level of trust.
   - **Weaknesses**: Truncating a 256-bit hash reduces the overall security of the function, potentially weakening collision resistance or making it more susceptible to preimage attacks. While the truncation reduces the size of the output, it does introduce the risk of reduced security, particularly in high-stakes environments like blockchain mining.

### Conclusion and Recommendation

Based on the comparison, the choice of the optimal 128-bit hash function for blockchain mining depends on the balance between security, speed, and ease of implementation. Here’s a summary of the key takeaways:

- **For miners with standard personal computers** who require a fast and efficient 128-bit hash function with relatively minimal computational overhead, **SipHash** emerges as an excellent choice due to its performance on small inputs, ease of implementation, and cryptographic security when a secret key is used.
- **Blake2b** provides the highest level of security and flexibility, but its higher computational overhead makes it less ideal for personal computer-based miners, especially if the network's efficiency is a top priority.
- **Truncated SHA-256** offers a familiar and secure algorithm but compromises security due to truncation, making it less desirable if maintaining high security is a key concern.

In conclusion, **SipHash** stands out as the most suitable option for 128-bit mining in this context, offering a solid balance between performance and security, particularly for lightweight and efficient mining. However, if the primary concern is higher security and the computational power of the miners is less of a constraint, **Blake2b** could be a better alternative, even though it comes with slightly higher resource requirements.
